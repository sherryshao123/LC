Suppose Andy and Doris want to choose a restaurant for dinner, and they both have a list of favorite restaurants represented by strings.

You need to help them find out their common interest with the least list index sum. If there is a choice tie between answers, output all of them with no order requirement. You could assume there always exists an answer.

Example 1:
Input:
["Shogun", "Tapioca Express", "Burger King", "KFC"]
["Piatti", "The Grill at Torrey Pines", "Hungry Hunter Steakhouse", "Shogun"]
Output: ["Shogun"]
Explanation: The only restaurant they both like is "Shogun".

    def findRestaurant(self, list1, list2):
        """
        :type list1: List[str]
        :type list2: List[str]
        :rtype: List[str]
        """
        dic = {}
        mins = len(list1) + len(list2) + 1
        res = []
        for i in xrange(len(list1)):
            dic[list1[i]] = i
        for j in xrange(len(list2)):
            if list2[j] in dic:
                if dic[list2[j]] + j == mins:
                    res.append(list2[j])
                
                if dic[list2[j]] + j < mins:
                    mins = dic[list2[j]] + j 
                    res = [list2[j]]
        return res
